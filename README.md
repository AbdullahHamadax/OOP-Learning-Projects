# 🚗 OOP Learning Projects 🏍

I will be making really simple (possibly one) projects in this repo for the purpose of learning OOP topics.

Welcome to the **Vehicle Rental System** project! This Java-based console application is designed to help you learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts while managing a rental inventory of motorcycles, trucks, and cars. Let's dive in!

## 🚀 Features

- View available motorcycles, trucks, and cars 🏍 🚚 🚗
- Rent vehicles by specifying the vehicle type, ID, and price 💰
- Add new vehicles to the inventory with details such as name, model, price, quantity, type, and manufacturing year 📝
- Validation of user inputs to ensure data integrity ✅
- Dynamic tax calculation based on the vehicle type 🧮
- User-friendly command-line interface 💻 ( I hate java's GUI )
- Clear and structured codebase with modular design 🧱

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) ☕ preferably the latest
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code 🧪
```
## 🛠 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahHamadax/OOP-Learning-Projects.git
```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Run the `Main.java` file to start the Vehicle Rental System.

## 📝 Usage

1. Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a menu with the following options:

   - View available vehicles 🚗
   - Rent a vehicle 🏍
   - Add a vehicle ➕
   - Exit 🚪

2. To view available vehicles, select option 1 and choose the vehicle type (A for motorcycles, B for trucks, C for cars).

3. To rent a vehicle, select option 2 and follow the prompts to specify the vehicle type, ID, and price.

4. To add a new vehicle to the inventory, select option 3 and follow the prompts to enter vehicle details.

5. Exit the application by selecting option 4.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following classes:

- `Main.java`: The main entry point of the application that handles user interactions.
- `Vehicle.java`: An abstract class representing the base class for all vehicle types.
- `Motorcycle.java`: A class representing motorcycle-specific properties and behaviors.
- `Truck.java`: A class representing truck-specific properties and behaviors.
- `Car.java`: A class representing car-specific properties and behaviors.
