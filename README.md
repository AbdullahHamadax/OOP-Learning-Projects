# 🚗 OOP Learning Projects 🏍

I will be making really simple (possibly one) projects in this repo for the purpose of learning OOP topics.

## 🚗 Vehicle Rental System Features 🚗 

- View available motorcycles, trucks, and cars 🏍 🚚 🚗
- Rent vehicles by specifying the vehicle type, ID, and price 💰
- Add new vehicles to the inventory with details such as name, model, price, quantity, type, and manufacturing year 📝
- Validation of user inputs to ensure data integrity ✅
- Dynamic tax calculation based on the vehicle type 🧮
- User-friendly command-line interface 💻 ( I hate java's GUI )
- Clear and structured codebase with modular design 🧱

## 📋 Prerequisites

```

3. Run the `Main.java` file to start whatever project you intend to try.

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts that are in some of my projects 🎯
